Clone-Resistant Hardware Authenticator
===================

A FIDO2 compliant Passwordless Hardware Authenticator built on the nRF52840 Development Kit using the nRF Connect SDK (v3.0.0).  
It uses the USB HID transport to support Passwordless Authentication via the FIDO2 protocol.

Overview
--------
This project is a work-in-progress implementation of a FIDO2 Authenticator device.  
It sets up a USB HID interface on the nRF52840 and handles communication with the host to support cryptographic operations as defined by the FIDO2 standard.
